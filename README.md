# leaflet-challenge

The repo "leaflet-challenge" is created to address the requirements of the Module 15 challenge (Mapping).


Inside the repo, the main folder is "Leaflet-Part-1". The following are included in the folder.


	- A Microsoft Edge HTML document called "index.html".


	- A folder called "static"...inside which two folders exist. The first folder is called "js", inside which a javaScript Source File called "logic.js" is included. the file "logic.js" contains the code to address the requirements of the challenge. The second folder is called "css", inside which a CSS Source File "style.css" is included. In style.css, some styling logic to serve "logic.js" is written 


Please be advised that this time around, I did not have the time to finish the bonus question (Part 2: Gather and Plot More Data).
