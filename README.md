The repo "leaflet-challenge" is created to address the requirements of Module 15 challenge (Mapping).


Inside the repo, the main folder is "Leaflet-Part-1". The following are included in the folder.


	- A Microsoft Edge HTML Documnet called "index.html".


	- A folder called "static"...inside which two folders exists. The first folder is called "js", inside which a javaScript Source File called "logic.js" is included. the file 	"logic.js" contains the code to address the requirments of the challenge. The second folder is called "css", inside which a CSS Source File "style.css" is included. In style.css, 	some styling logic to serve "logic.js" is written
